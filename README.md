# Puzzle Empire

This is a all in one puzzle app where people can design their own
puzzles and also play other peoples puzzles from around the world.

For the first version of this application, we will be focussing
on classic Sudoku puzzles, before expanding this to Sudoku's with
custom rulesets (e.g. arrows, thermometers etc.) and then later on
completley different puzzle variants.

This app is created using React.
